# Calculator

Hello! My name is Honk and, as the header suggests, I will be creating a calculator.

I won't lie, I'm pretty worried about this project. I've already made an attempt at a calculator quite a while back, and although I had practically none of the necessary knowledge I made it pretty far. However, I am still somewhat doubtful about my abilities. The Odin Project said I should feel confident in my JavaScript skills by now, but I don't.

Probably because I've used for loops instead of array methods one too many times, but that's besides the point. I'm worried and the methods I use aren't always the most efficient, but I have always come out with a functional program and that's what really matters to me.

In my last project README I mentioned wanting to experiment more with styling, and I won't make any promises to myself, but as of right now that is still something I plan to do. I have a few ideas already.

Without further to do I'll be starting the project. I'll be back to update about things that I've learned and final thoughts afterwards!


After what feels like forever, I'm finally finished! I can't express how happy I am to be done with the final project of The Odin Project's foundation course, and almost done with the foundation course as a whole!

This project was difficult to say the least, but not at all in the way I expected. Creating the features for the calculator wasn't the hard part. Fixing the bugs that came with the features... Now that was tough. It felt like every time I added a feature one to two new bugs appeared, or old bugs came back from the dead. I struggled to the point that I had to restart once because I just wasn't happy with how it was coming along.

I'm not 100% happy with the visual aspect of the calculator because creativity was sadly not coming to me for this one. However, I'm glad that I put in much more effort in the looks this time around.

Anyways, onto the things that I've learned.

- I did not know it was possible to edit or erase old commits, so learning about git rebase -i and git commit --amend was a pleasant surprise. I still don't understand how to use git rebase that well, but it's nice to know that it exists.
- In my last few projects I was confused about what to do when I wanted or needed to make a change but it didn't relate to what the current branch was about, and I realized that making changes to the main branch did not carry over to the branches made before the change. Git merge main was a huge help when it came to this.
- I'm becoming more familiar with some of the most common branching commands. At first I had to revisit the page on The Odin Project where it was first mentioned to remember
the exact syntax of the commands, but now I have them memorized.
- The importance of creating functions for reusability has been reinforced, because a lot of things needed to be called multiple times in this project.
- I learned the importance of erasing pseudocode and branches the moment that they're unnecessary from this project and the last few. If I don't erase them immediately then I get stuck erasing them all at once later.
- This once is silly, but from this project and the last few I realized that HTML must start with !DOCTYPE not DOCTYPE. I mistaken thought that !DOCTYPE was the shortcut for getting it to autocomplete is VSCode. This error messed up the structure of the DOM tree in my previous projects, but I have since gone back to fix that and prevented making that same mistake here.
- The parent < child combinator is very helpful
- It is oftentimes quicker to write !(elem) than elem !==.
- In my next project I'd let to set all my undefined variables to null from the beginning. I've heard that when undefined appears after doing this it is easier to know that something is wrong. 

Final thing I'd like to say is thank you so much to The Odin Project for helping me and so many others learn how to code and program! I still have a long way to go but I'm eager to keep learning and to improve to the point that I can truly create something of my own from beginning to end.
