# Calculator

Hello! My name is Honk and, as the header suggests, I will be creating a calculator.

I won't lie, I'm pretty worried about this project. I've already made an attempt at a calculator quite a while back, and although I had practically none of the necessary knowledge I made it pretty far. However, I am still somewhat doubtful about my abilities. The Odin Project said I should feel confident in my JavaScript skills by now, but I don't.

Probably because I've used for loops instead of array methods one too many times, but that's besides the point. I'm worried and the methods I use aren't always the most efficient, but I have always come out with a functional program and that's what really matters to me.

In my last project README I mentioned wanting to experiment more with styling, and I won't make any promises to myself, but as of right now that is still something I plan to do. I have a few ideas already.

Without further to do I'll be starting the project. I'll be back to update about things that I've learned and final thoughts afterwards!
